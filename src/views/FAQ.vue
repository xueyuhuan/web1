            <el-collapse-item title="Q: KNOWING THE SPECIFICATION OF YOUR VEHICLE" name="2">
                <p>Knowing the specifications of your vehicle is crucial/essential when it comes to finding the correct parts for your vehicle. More often than not, we typically only need the Year, Make, Model and the Engine size [or even simpler, your vehicle’s VIN #] to identify/locate the correct brake parts for your car.</p>
                <p>For example: You might be driving a 2008 (Year) Dodge (Make) Grand Caravan (Model) 3.3L V6 (Engine Size). Some vehicles are super easy to locate kits for, like this one. However, for some vehicle models, we will require additional information to cross reference our database the correct parts.</p>
                <p>Let’s say you have a 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan 3.6L V6. For 2012 models, we have to confirm the manufacture date of the vehicle [alters the size of the pads], as well as whether you have Single Piston Calipers or Dual Piston Calipers for the front rotors of your vehicle [alters the size of your front rotors] to verify which parts you will need. Without confirming the manufacture date and the type of calipers you have, we cannot be 100% sure about the fitment for the 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan. This is the reason why we always have to double or even triple check in regards to your vehicle specs.</p>
                <p>On rare occasions, there are vehicle specifications we cannot identify even with the correct VIN number, which is why we strongly suggest calling your dealership and ask for your OEM part number. This is the safest and most efficient way to determine your vehicle specs.</p>

            <el-collapse-item title="Q: FINDING THE TRIM OR SUB-MODEL OF MY VEHICLE" name="3">
                <p>The trim/sub-model of the vehicle is often stated on the back of the car, for example: LE is the trim for the Toyota Camry, and SEL is the trim for the Ford Fusion.</p>
                <p>If you are unsure about the trim/sub-model of your vehicle, give your dealership a call to get the exact trim specifications.</p>

            <el-collapse-item title="Q: SOLID vs. VENTED ROTORS" name="4">
                <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0047/4221/7841/files/Vented_Solid_Rotors.png?14153774810088499089" alt=""/>
                <p>Solid disc brake rotor has One solid brake disc</p>
                <p>Vented disc brake rotor has Two brake discs conjoined at the middle by vanes or lined structures</p>
                <p>Note: If you have solid rotors on your vehicle, you cannot replace or upgrade them to vented rotors. The same applies for vented rotors.</p>
                <p>Purchasing a conversion kit would allow you to replace solid rotors with vented rotors. However, we do not recommend this; it is a very costly operation and does not improve your braking performance in anyway.</p>

            <el-collapse-item title="Q: SINGLE vs. DUAL PISTON CALIPERS" name="5">
                <p>When you remove your wheel & look at the backside of the caliper</p>
                <p>Two Smaller Pistons</p>
                <p>Single Large Piston</p>
                <p>Note: There are also 4 piston, 6 piston and 8 piston calipers which are usually found on heavy duty and high performance vehicles.</p>
                <p>Regular vehicle models will use single or dual piston calipers for the most part (most of the time).</p>

            <el-collapse-item title="Q: ROTORS vs. DRUMS" name="6">
                <p>Disc Brakes</p>
                <p>Flat, Disk-Shaped Metal</p>
                <p>Uses Brake Pads</p>
                <p>FYI: Most recent vehicle models have eliminated the use of brake drums</p>
                <p>Drum Brakes</p>
                <p>Wide Cylinder with an open back, resembling the top of a drum</p>
                <p>Uses Brake Shoes</p>

            <el-collapse-item title="Q: NUMBER OF LUGS OF YOUR ROTOR" name="7">
                <p>The number of lugs (mounting holes, studs or bolts) on the rotor hat can vary depending on the sub-model or trim of the vehicle.</p>
                <p>NOTE: In some instances we may need to know the diameter size of the lug to confirm fitment.</p>
            </el-collapse-item>
            <el-collapse-item title="Q: FINDING THE DIAMETER SIZE OF YOUR ROTORS" name="8">
                <p>CALL THE DEALERSHIP</p>
                <p>The best way to obtain diameter size information is to call your dealership with your VIN# and they will provide you the exact diameter size for your rotors.</p>
                <p>MEASURE IT YOURSELF</p>
                <p>If calling the dealership is not an option for you, you can instead measure it yourself. On the face of the rotor, measure from one side to the other (usually measured in mm or inches).</p>
            </el-collapse-item>
            <el-collapse-item title="Q: ANTI-RUST COATING BEHAVIOR" name="9">
                <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0047/4221/7841/files/Brake_disc_before_and_after_rust_prevention.jpg?14153774810088499089" alt=""/>
                <p>The Anti-rust coating around the braking areas of the rotor will eventually wear off after use. This is normal and unavoidable. However, the hat, vents and other parts of the rotor where the pads do not come into contact will remain protected.</p>
                <p>Rust will eventually build up around the braking surface of the rotors if your vehicle remained stationary or exposed to natural elements for a prolonged period. This build up of rust will scrape off right away as soon as you put your vehicle in motion and let the brake pads clean the rust off the braking surface of your rotors.</p>
